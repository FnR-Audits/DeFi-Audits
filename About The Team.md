'I started my journey in DeFi in April 2022. Like most, unfortunately I was on the receiving end of projects that failed / rugged and completely disappeared. From that point it has been a passion of mine to expand my skills in order to call out projects both publicly and privately for suspicious activity. I use my skills in on-chain analysis and data science to help investigate how projects are behaving on the blockchain. I also spend my spare time learning how to audit smart contracts using tools such as REMIX to load and analyse solidity files.'

'I graduated as a Software Engineer, then I've been an IT Auditor for 3 years for a large Bank.
I've discovered the blockchain world in March 2020 and it became a passion for me. 
Naturally, I've moved from retail trader, to DeFi user, to DeFi builder and finally to smart contract auditor. 
Now I'm actively developing my expertise in the field of Blockchain Security through more learning and field work.'

"I am a passionate developer that has been into the space for the past 2 years developing smart contract, I discovered that most project don't really care and give a lot of attention about how much their contract is secure. This was my motivation to start learning more about security of SC, bugs, audits and from that time till now I am constantly developing my skills as a developer and smart contract auditor for a better DeFi"

Our auditing team will consist of three members to begin, but we are constantly networking with talent and will continue to expand, depending on the demand.
