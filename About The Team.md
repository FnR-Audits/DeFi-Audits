Our auditing team will consist of three members to begin, but we are constantly networking with talent and will continue to expand, depending on the demand.

*Team Member 1 - CEO Andeh:

'I started my journey in DeFi in April 2022. Like most, unfortunately I was on the receiving end of projects that failed / rugged and completely disappeared. From that point it has been a passion of mine to expand my skills in order to call out projects both publicly and privately for suspicious activity. I use my skills in on-chain analysis and data science to help investigate how projects are behaving on the blockchain. I also spend my spare time learning how to audit smart contracts using tools such as REMIX to load and analyse solidity files.'
